// 1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors plus 0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won

// GUESSING WITH MESSY PSEUDO CODE BEFORE CODE ALONG

// look at the fetch cards example with George -- taking objects in array and sorting them by house... take the elf answer pairs and sort them by rock, paper, and scissors?

// or assign values to answer pairs with GIANT for loop? let answer pairs = whatever point value. if a === thrown && y === thrown, console.log(numberOfPoints), else if b === thrown && x === thrown console.log(numberOfPoints)... would need to have a bunch of these to account for draws and losses... woof

// or assign values to answer pairs with forEach? for each win, do this; for each loss, do this; for each draw, do this... this might be better? but then how would I total the points for selection...
